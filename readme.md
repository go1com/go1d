# GO1D 
## Overview
GO1D (Spoken Gold) stands for GO1 Design System and is a library of mostly static components for building interfaces. This repo should contain minimal components with more stateful components being in `GO1D/Mine` module.

## Installation
```sh
npm install @go1d/go1d
```

## Documentation
- Can be found at [https://go1d.go1.com/](https://go1d.go1.com/)
- (WIP) Developer documentation can be found at [https://go1d.go1.com/storybook](https://go1d.go1.com/storybook)

## Build / Run
```sh
npm run docs:dev
npm run storybook
npm run npm:dev

npm run docs:build
npm run storybook:build
npm run npm:build
```

## Testing
```sh
npm test --coverage
```

##Happo.io cross-browser screenshot testing
This feature currently is still experimental, please contact shangzhi.pan@go1.com for further information if you want to use it.

## Live Editing
### Setup
- Clone both repos. This assumes they are in the same directory
- install dependencies of both in their repos via yarn or npm
- in GO1D repo run `npm run npm:dev`
- in another tab run inside content loader folder `npm link ../GO1D/build` (On Windows you might need to stop yarn in GO1D Repo, you also have to relink every time you used npm to add or update a package)
- inside content loader run `npm start`

### Starting
- in GO1D repo run `npm run npm:dev`
- inside content loader run `yarn start`

* Cian O'Leary (cian.oleary@go1.com)
* Luke Brooker (luke.brooker@go1.com)
* Stephen Mudra (stephen.mudra@go1.com)

## Contribute
Components should be documented in docs/components with at least:
* A one or two line description of the component with it’s use case
* Major use cases of the component
* It’s current development status & release version

Component should have at least one story with all props in the "stories" folder. You can find a tutorial on how to add stories for storybook [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react/). 

## Developer Guide
### Dos
- Add a `displayName` to your Component
- Export your component as `default`
- Check if there are similar libs already included before adding other 3rd party libs, keep our dependency list short!
- ALWAYS check the Happo Visual Regression Report before merging changes.
- Remember to use shorthands like: `marginY={[6, 7, 8]}` instead of `marginTop={6} marginBottom={6} css={{[breakpoints.md]: {margin: ......};[breakpoints.lg]: {margin: ......}}}` 
### Don'ts
- Avoid imports of other GO1D components into your component through the /components/index.ts file. 
    - Avoid `import {View} from "../index"` or `import {View} from "../"`   or `import {View} from "../../"`
    - Instad use `import View, {ViewProps} from "../View"`
- Do not add icon's with opacity if they are not intended. Double check if the Icon Path is included twice in the SVG file.

## Adding Icons
Add the svg to src/icons and then run `yarn icons`. Make sure to include any created files in the commit.
