# Known Issues

## #1
We have some import like this:

```javascript
import merge = require("lodash/merge");
```

which doesn't work with `babel` specifically `@babel/preset-typescript`. This piece of code should only work with `tsc` compiler.
While in our `tsconfig.json`, we leave `{ "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true }` this means allow to import default export `import x from "y"`, howerver,
above option should come with `{ esModuleInterop: true }`. I think this is why we had a `require` like issue #1.
