## Storybook

We use Storybook for our design system to make component-driven development, testing, and communication easier.

- [Go1d storybook](https://go1d.go1.com/storybook/?path=/docs/overview--page) for our open-source presentational components
- [Mine storybook](https://go1d.pages.go1.co/mine/) for our stateful components

## Overview

The Go1d design system is primarily made of 2 component libraries: Go1d and Mine.

- “Go1d” is our main design system component library. Its source code lives in [Gitlab go1d/GO1D](https://code.go1.com.au/go1d/GO1D) and we use [a mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/go1com) to make the code open source. It contains things like buttons, avatars, data tables, modals, cards, tabs, tooltips, etc.
- “Mine” is for our stateful components code and its source code lives in [Gitlab go1d/mine](https://code.go1.com.au/go1d/mine). The clearest example is the TopMenu navigation that contains business logic, such as user permissions and menu items for a logged in user.

These are supported by:

- [`@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports) (more on that below)

We also maintain related front-end projects:

- “Go1d Exchange” is for all our API calls. It includes models, such as Portal and Enrolment, and no UI or React views. It doesn't strictly belong to the design system because it has no design, but instead houses shared front-end resources.
- “Retriever” contains business React Components for Explore page, including UI and API calls to make for the Explore UI work using 1Query

## Installing Go1d

To add Go1d to the project you are working on, run:

```bash
npm install -s @go1d/go1d
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @go1d/go1d
```

### Babel configuration

To transform Go1d imports and allow tree-shaking instead of pulling in the entire Go1d library, you can also run `yarn add -D @go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports` or `npm install --save-dev @go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports` to install [`@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports). Then add something like this to your `.babelrc` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports"
  ]
}
```

### Global CSS Reset & Fonts

The easiest way to set up the CSS reset and fonts is to include the following code in the root JavaScript file of the project:

```
import { globalCSS } from "@go1d/go1d";
globalCSS();
```

Most Go1d components require you to call the `globalCSS` function to add the required CSS rules and fonts to the project.

If Go1d components look different to the documentation website this is the most likely cause.

## Preparing a project for Go1d

After you've installed Go1d, configured Babel, and imported the globalCSS, set up the provider and link components.

### Provider

#### Themes

The theme provider allows us to customize the colors across all child Go1d components. We typically pass a customer's team theme to this provider. Specifically, customers will see UI components tinted with their brand accent color through this theming.

It's recommended to include the Provider component in the root JavaScript file of the project:

```
import Provider from "@go1d/go1d/build/components/Provider";
ReactDOM.render(<Provider accent="yellow"><App /></Provider>, domNode);
```

If you need to control the Provider based on http requests, ensure the Provider is as high up the DOM tree as possible.

#### Links

If your project is using React Router or another routing solution you will need to also pass in a Link Component into the Provider.

This will ensure all links rendered by Go1d components will be passed though the Router of choice.

A Link in Go1d expects the same props as a DOM anchor tag. So if you are using React Router you will need to create a wrapping component to translate the `href` prop to `to`

```
ReactDOM.render(<Provider linkComponent={Link}><App /></Provider>, domNode);
```
