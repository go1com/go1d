## Storybook

We use Storybook for our design system to make component-driven development, testing, and communication easier.

- [Go1d storybook](https://go1d.go1.com/storybook/?path=/docs/overview--page) for our open-source presentational components
- [Mine storybook](https://go1d.pages.go1.co/mine/) for our stateful components

### Go1d storybook

## Installing Go1d

To add Go1d to the project you are working on, run:

```bash
npm install -s @go1d/go1d
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @go1d/go1d
```

### Babel configuration

To transform Go1d imports and allow tree-shaking instead of pulling in the entire Go1d library, you can also run `yarn add -D @go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports` or `npm install --save-dev @go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports` to install [`@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports). Then add something like this to your `.babelrc` file:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@go1d/babel-plugin-transform-go1d-imports"
  ]
}
```

### Global CSS Reset & Fonts

The easiest way to set up the CSS reset and fonts is to include the following code in the root JavaScript file of the project:

```
import { globalCSS } from "@go1d/go1d";
globalCSS();
```

Most Go1d components require you to call the `globalCSS` function to add the required CSS rules and fonts to the project.

If Go1d components look different to the documentation website this is the most likely cause.

## Preparing a project for Go1d

### Provider

#### Themes

The theme provider allows us to customize the colors across all child Go1d components. We typically pass a customer's team theme to this provider. Specifically, customers will see UI components tinted with their brand accent color through this theming.

It's recommended to include the Provider component in the root JavaScript file of the project:

```
import Provider from "@go1d/go1d/build/components/Provider";
ReactDOM.render(<Provider accent="yellow"><App /></Provider>, domNode);
```

If you need to control the Provider based on http requests, ensure the Provider is as high up the DOM tree as possible.

#### Links

If your project is using React Router or another routing solution you will need to also pass in a Link Component into the Provider.

This will ensure all links rendered by Go1d components will be passed though the Router of choice.

A Link in Go1d expects the same props as a DOM anchor tag. So if you are using React Router you will need to create a wrapping component to translate the `href` prop to `to`

```
ReactDOM.render(<Provider linkComponent={Link}><App /></Provider>, domNode);
```
