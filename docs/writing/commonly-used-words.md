There are certain words and terms that we use frequently in Go1 materials that can be a bit confusing.

Ever wondered if you should use eLearning or e-learning in your content? Or maybe e-Learning?

While all of these spelling variations are acceptable, we like to keep things consistent in our customer-facing materials.

So to answer all your questions, in one definitive list, here’s how we write some of those tricky terms.

*Note: if you think of any good ones we’ve missed, let us know!*
