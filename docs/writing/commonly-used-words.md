There are certain words and terms that we use frequently in GO1 materials that can be a bit confusing. 

Ever wondered if you should use eLearning or e-learning in your content? Or maybe e-Learning? 

While all of these spelling variations are acceptable, we like to keep things consistent in our customer-facing materials. 

So to answer all your questions, in one definitive list, here’s how we write some of those tricky terms.  

*Note: if you think of any good ones we’ve missed, let us know!*
