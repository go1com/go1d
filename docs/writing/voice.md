While the Go1 team is made up of many different voices, we like to communicate with our audience in one clear, consistent tone.

Having a clear â€˜Go1 voiceâ€™ across all our marketing materials helps us to create high quality content that our customers, partners, and other followers can recognize and connect with. A clear tone of voice leads to better customer engagement and higher sales.

Whether theyâ€™re reading a sales brochure, browsing the Go1 website, or reading articles on the blog, we want people to feel supported, informed, and engaged â€“ not confused by a lot of complex terminology or jargon.

## So: how do we do this?

Every time you communicate for Go1, commit to using the Go1 voice.

Weâ€™ve created this voice by building it around three distinct dimensions of tone.

These three dimensions of tone are:

* supportive
* bright, and
* clear.

You can think of these dimensions of tone as individual dials, which you can turn up or down depending on your audience or the channel youâ€™re communicating through.

For example, you may want to turn up the brightness for a social media post. Or turn it down a notch for a product release, to focus more on providing clarity and support.

### Supportive

We are helpful and friendly, providing global 24/7 support. We aim to enable and empower our customers, so they can enable and empower their learners.

* Choose positive action words.
* Provide the information thatâ€™s needed.
* Be warm, genuine and respectful.

âœ… Supportive is: friendly, knowledgeable, empathetic.

ðŸš« Supportive is not: patronizing or overwhelming with information.

### Bright

We are passionate about who we are and what we do. We are leaders in our industry and excited to share our expertise and love of learning with the world.

* Be conversational, but not too casual.
* Add some warmth and positive energy to your words.
* Share your knowledge in an accessible and authentic way.

âœ… Bright is: upbeat, warm, smart ;)

ðŸš« Bright is not: overly familiar, fake, shouty.

### Clear

We are clear in our communication. We take the time to choose the right words to ensure clarity, transparency and understanding. We always ask ourselves 'can this be made clearer?â€™

* Use short, simple sentences.
* Avoid corporate jargon and overly complicated words.
* Write as though you are talking face-to-face with someone.

âœ… Clear is: direct, accessible, transparent.

ðŸš« Clear is not: wishy washy, overly erudite, abrupt.

Follow these guidelines next time youâ€™re creating an ad, writing a blog article, drafting an email, or pulling together a presentation.

This will help keep our Go1 voice and brand personality shining through.
