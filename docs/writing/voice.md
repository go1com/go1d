While the GO1 team is made up of many different voices, we like to communicate with our audience in one clear, consistent tone. 

Having a clear ‘GO1 voice’ across all our marketing materials helps us to create high quality content that our customers, partners, and other followers can recognize and connect with. 

Whether they’re reading a sales brochure, browsing the GO1 website, or reading articles on the blog, we want people to feel supported, informed, and engaged - not confused by a lot of complex terminology or jargon. 

Some tips for writing in the GO1 voice:

- The GO1 voice is genuine, direct and approachable.
- We keep our language and grammar plain and simple, as we believe jargon is a barrier.
- We use short, simple sentences to maximize clarity. 
- Our language is active and inclusive, reflecting our culture, values, and mission. 
- We understand that the burden of communication rests on us as the person trying to be understood.

Following these guidelines when writing content for GO1 will help keep our voice and brand personality shining through.
