In this section, we would like to provide you with some important guidance on appropriate word usage for certain topics. The following guidelines are to be used for all internal and external communications, to make sure that we are using language that makes all people feel safe, seen, and included.



## Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders

Always capitalize ‘Indigenous’ and ‘Aboriginal’ when you’re referring to Australian Aboriginals. This is not needed when you are referring generally to the original inhabitants of other continents.

To refer to the entire Indigenous community, use terms like Aboriginal Australians or Indigenous Australians. Use Aboriginal or Indigenous as adjectives.

Torres Strait Islanders should always be written in full.



## Disability, community and mental health

When writing content that relates to our training offerings in the disability and community space, avoid using words such as “handicapped,” “suffer,” or “victim.”

If you need to mention it, use language that emphasizes the person first: “she has a disability” rather than “she is disabled.” Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.

Similarly, when writing about mental health, avoid terms such as “suffering” and “mentally ill.” We recommend using terms such as “people who experience anxiety or depression.”
