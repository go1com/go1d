How many times have you been writing content and thought:

* “Should I use a hyphen there?”
* “Is there a capital on that?”
* “Wait… is that one word or two?”

We get it – grammar and punctuation can be confusing. And there are many grammatically correct ways of structuring a sentence. These guidelines should help to lift that confusion.

Here are some of the most common grammar and punctuation issues that people seek guidance on. How we refer to our brand, write numbers, dates, time and abbreviations must be consistent across all touchpoints.

Use this section as a quick reference tool. You can browse topics alphabetically, or click on the topic to jump through to the relevant section.



## Abbreviations and acronyms

Like all industries and organizations, we get used to using certain abbreviations and acronyms on a daily basis.

When writing for an external audience, you need to remember that your reader might not be familiar with those terms.

Spell out all abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are mentioned. Then use the short version throughout the remainder of the text.

**For example**

> Learn more about using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the workplace.

> Integrate with your own Learning Management System (LMS) or use ours.

----------

## Bullet points (lists)

Confused about how to use bullet points in a list? Here’s how we do it.

If each bullet point is a full sentence, end them all with a full stop.

**For example**

> Why join the Go1 Partner Program?
>
> * Access to our proven partner integration patterns, or we can work with you to develop a custom partner solution to suit your needs.
> * Access the Go1 Partner Hub to self-manage your clients who are using the Go1 learning platform.
> * Your Partner Manager will be available to support you through the partner process and answer your questions.

If your bullet points are *not* full sentences, use a full stop at the end of the last one. Use a colon at the end of your introductory or lead-in sentence.

**For example**

> In this course, you’ll learn more about:
>
> * compliance requirements for your industry
> * your responsibilities as an employer
> * how you can protect your employees from workplace injuries.

If your bullet points are simply a list of courses, there is no need to use full stops at the end of each bullet point. You will still need to use a colon at the end of your introductory or lead-in sentence.

**For example**

> Course topics include:
>
> * Information and Cyber Security
> * Bullying and Cyberbullying
> * Protection and Malware

In the last two bullet point lists, there’s no need to use capitals to start each bullet point unless the first word is a proper noun, such as a company, job or course title.

## Commas

Oxford comma – yes

----------

## Dates

In Go1 materials, use the following date style: Monday 8 April 2021

When writing, always spell out the month in full. Include the day wherever possible.

**For example**

> 4 February 1967
> Wednesday 7 March 2012

Don’t forget to specify your time zone when writing about an event or webinar. And spell out the time zone in brackets so our global audience will know what the acronym means.

**For example**

> 10am AEDT (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)
> 4pm PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)
> 6pm BST (British Summer Time)

----------

## Dashes

At Go1, we prefer to use spaced en dashes instead of em dashes. This makes line wrapping easier. Otherwise, many editors and viewers would treat “Insider—September” without spaces as a single word, leading to awkward line wrapping.

> ✅ The Go1 Content Insider – September 2021 edition

> 🚫 The Go1 Content Insider—September 2021 edition

----------

## Headings and subheadings

At Go1, we like to use sentence case for all headings.

Sentence case is when the first word and any proper nouns begin with a capital letter, but everything else is in lower case.

**For example**

> Browse Go1 Content Hub
> Enrol in online courses
> Partner with Go1

----------

## Links (hyperlinks)

It’s best to include words describing where the hyperlink goes, rather than simply saying “click here!” The link text should describe what the user will see when they click on it.

**For example**

> [Register](https://www.go1.com/en-au/events) for the next Go1 webinar
> [View all our online compliance courses](https://www.go1.com/en-au/content-hub#compliance)

----------

## Numbers 

Rule of thumb: spell out numbers one to nine (except in page numbers, percentages, and social media posts).

Always spell out a number when it begins a sentence. Otherwise, use the numeral.

Write numbers greater than 999 with a comma. Example: **1,000**, **28,500**, **394,500**.

When the number goes into the millions, write the amount in words and figures.

**For example**

> Nine participants
> 5,000 online courses

----------

## Time

No need to put a space between the number and am or pm. You do not need a full stop after am or pm either.

**For example**

> 5am
> 9.30pm

When you are including the period of time in a sentence, use words (such as between or to) instead of a dash.

**For example**

> The next Go1 All Hands meeting will be held from 9am to 4pm on Thursday.
> The webinar takes place between 9am and 10am on Monday.

----------

## Titles

When writing Go1 content, we often refer to the titles of training courses, events, reports, papers, newspapers, books, and so forth.

When referring to the title of something, we suggest *italicizing* the course title to make it stand out.

**For example**

> I’d recommend the *Introduction to HR* online course…
> In an article in *The Financial Review*…
> We recently attended the *Microsoft Future Now* conference…
> Have you seen the new *Game of Thrones* episode yet?

For titles, use title case, with all words capitalized (other than **a**, **an**, **and**, **of**, **on** and **the** – unless they are the first word of the title).

----------

## Quotation marks

If you’re writing something that someone said, use quotation marks.

Go1’s editorial style is to use double quotation marks. Only use single quotation marks for quoted words contained within an existing quote.

**For example**

> “We are excited to launch our new website,” Andrew said.

**For example**

> “Andrew said to me, ‘We’re excited to launch our new website’,” Scott said.

Hot tip: full stops and commas go *inside* quotation marks. The exception to this rule is if you’re asking a question that ends with a quote – in that case, the question mark goes outside the quote.

Note: Sometimes people also use quotation marks for the titles of courses, books or publications. We prefer to stick to *italics* for titles – see the section above.
