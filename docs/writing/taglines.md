title: Taglines

---

Taglines are used to clearly communicate a company’s brand personality, message and market position. 

They are often considered the brand’s ‘catchphrase’ and should be short, powerful and easy to remember. You can probably recognize a number of brands by their tagline alone!

At GO1, we currently have three approved taglines for you to use on your materials. Please be aware that we will be reviewing and updating these taglines in Q2 2019 - we will be sure to keep you updated on any changes. For now, please continue to use the taglines below on your marketing materials. 

## Primary tagline 
Making learning easy 
Our primary tagline communicates the overall benefit of our product. 

## Secondary tagline
The world’s largest marketplace of training
Our secondary tagline shows our point of position and comparison in the market. 

## Tertiary tagline
Thousands of courses. One simple solution. 
Our tertiary tagline can be used as a copy tagline on promotional and marketing materials. 


Taglines are a strong and important part of our brand identity and are not to be altered in any way. If you are unsure how or where to use GO1 taglines, reach out to the Marketing team and we’ll guide you through.
