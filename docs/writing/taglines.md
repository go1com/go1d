Taglines are used to clearly communicate a company’s brand personality, message, and market position.

They are often considered the brand’s ‘catchphrase’ and should be short, powerful, and easy to remember. You can probably recognize a number of brands by their tagline alone!

At Go1, we currently have three taglines for you to use on your materials. Please be aware that these are evolving. For now, please continue to use the taglines below on your marketing materials.

## Primary tagline

> **One login. A whole world of digital learning.**

A primary tagline communicates the overall benefit of our product.

## Secondary tagline

> **Tens of thousands of courses. One subscription.**

A secondary tagline shows our point of position and comparison in the market.

## Tertiary tagline

> **Small L&D team. Big impact.**

A tertiary tagline can be used as a copy tagline on promotional and marketing materials.
