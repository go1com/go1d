## Primary logo
You will become most familiar with the primary logo, as it appears on the majority of GO1 print and web materials.

## Secondary logo
While the primary logo is used most frequently, there is also a secondary logo which may be used on print and web materials in particular circumstances.

There may be occasions where you will need to print the logo on a solid background, in which case you can use a reversed mono version of the GO1 logo.

You can see examples of the logo being used in its correct reversed variations here.
 
## Correct usage
When using the GO1 logo, it’s important to make sure that you don’t skew, stretch or alter the logo in any way. Always follow these guidelines to maintain the logo’s correct form, scale and proportions.
 
**Clear space**
You need to ensure that the logo is not being crowded or overpowered by any other design elements.

The amount of clear space used around a logo establishes an invisible exclusion zone around it. This area of clear space, known as the isolation area, must not be occupied by any other design elements.
 
**Minimum sizes**
Guidelines relating to minimum size of the logo are also used, to make sure that all typographic elements of the logo are clear and readable.
When using the GO1 logo, you must not reduce the logo to any size smaller than 10mm in height. This is the logo’s minimum size rule.
