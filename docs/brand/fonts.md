## Photographs and images

Like all design elements, photographs and images must follow our organization’s visual identity guidelines.

As with the GO1 logo, photographs should never be stretched or skewed to fit a space. When placing photographs within a design, the size should be 100%, for both height and width.

If you are including photos in any of your materials, make sure that they have been sourced from our <link> GO1 image library. This is a collection of approved images and photographs that have been taken by professional photographers and cleared for use.
 
The images used for GO1 materials should always reflect the diversity of our global organization and brand.
