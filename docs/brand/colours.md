Our colors give our brand its distinct and consistent visual tone. Our primary deep green brings a sense of maturity to our palette, which is contrasted by an energetic green as a highlight color. Our creme and Salmon tones add a sense of warmth and accessibility to the brand.

For cohesion across all our touch points, our marketing and product colors all stem from our brand colors below.

## A note about color formats

**CMYK:** CMYK refers to the four inks used in colour printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black). This breakdown should be used when applying the logo to full colour print application. When the logo and branding is printed using four colour process, use the CMYK breakdown for both colours.

**RGB:** The RGB breakdowns are to be used when applying the logo for branding to screen-based communications. Adhere to RGB guidelines when working with websites, emails or PowerPoint presentations, for example.

**Remember: CMYK for print materials; RGB for online.**
