lead: We base all GO1D design decisions on these principles. They keep our user experience easy, lean and digestible.

## Be holistic

Create components with the larger picture in mind. Components should be reused as a rule and never designed with only one page or flow in mind.

## Be accessible

Create an experience that everyone can use and appreciate regardless of vision, hearing, cognitive or motor impairments.

## Make it themable

Create experiences that can be themed. When used by our partners (or enthusiastic users), they can seamlessly be in their GO1 location while adhering to their own branding guidelines.

## Record record record

Document as much as possible - but don’t go overboard. If you didn’t make it to work tomorrow, would others be able to pick up where you left off?

## Keep it simple

Exactly.

## Consistency

Create components that are consistent as in, they are inline with our brand/styles and ensure a seamless user experience.

## Don’t think, just be

Ensure that our user experince doesn’t require thought. Our users should ONLY be focused on their content and at ease with how to navigate and use our system. No rage clicks.
