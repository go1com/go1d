Principles help us make decisions when faced with new scenarios.

## Alive

It reacts to the users every move or intent. It’s malleable and adaptive.

It feels connected. To the communities that use it, and the content and data that power it.

We aim for alive even over steady.

**For example**

Connecting Shapes illustrate the many pathways of the learning journey and the Go1’s ability to adaptively respond to content, new partnerships and platform integration. They do this by connecting relevant pieces of content and highlighting key information in our communications.



## Essential

It’s focused on what is needed right now

It’s the 20%, that 80% of users need – Pareto principle / Progressive disclosure

We aim for essential even over comprehensive.

**For example**

The Collapse component is used to collapse and expand content inline on a page. This lets users progressively disclose information when they want.



## Smart

It’s refined and elegant, not overt or gaudy.

It anticipates the next move. It’s personalised, not customised.

We aim for smart even over striking.

**For example**

Buttons indicate what actions are possible to users. Subtle buttons reduce visual noise when there are many action of equal importance on the page. Minimal button is a tertiary button that can be used in conjunction and support accent and subtle buttons, but still easily discoverable by the user.
