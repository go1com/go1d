Welcome to the *GO1 Design & Editorial Style Guide*. 

We have created this style guide for all GO1 employees to use as a reference when creating content.  

One of the key functions of the GO1 Marketing team is to make sure all customer-facing content, across all teams and channels, is clear and consistent - in branding, visual identity, editorial style and messaging. That’s why all externally published materials and marketing activities must be approved by the GO1 Marketing team. 

Both our **visual identity** and our **editorial style** play a key role in building strong recognition of our company’s image and brand. It’s important that we maintain a consistent ‘look and feel’ across all our advertising, marketing materials, and event collateral - both online and print. 

Throughout this style guide, you’ll find information on how to use GO1’s **visual design** elements in a consistent, clear and correct way. You’ll also find **editorial guidelines**, to help you you write content that follows the approved GO1 editorial style for voice, grammar and punctuation. 

These guidelines aren’t here to cramp your style - we simply want you to feel confident in creating the best content possible. Our aim is to help you communicate with your customers, content partners, and the broader public in a way which complements the GO1 brand, values and commitment to quality. 

So next time you’re putting together any external materials for GO1, we hope you’ll find this guide to be a helpful resource.
