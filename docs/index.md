menuTitle: Overview
lead: Go1d (spoken “Gold”) is Go1’s design system. It is the single source of truth for our design language and contains shared resources including guidelines, editorial content, design assets, and code for efficiently creating consistent Go1 products.
---

Throughout the documentation in this system, you’ll find information on how to use Go1’s **brand identity** and **visual design** elements in a consistent, clear and correct way. You’ll also find **editorial guidelines**, to help you you write content that follows the approved Go1 editorial style for voice, grammar and punctuation. There are also many components available with documentation to help you build Go1 products.

These guidelines aren’t here to cramp your style – we simply want you to feel confident in creating the best content possible. Our aim is to help you communicate with your customers, content partners, and the broader public in a way which complements the Go1 brand, values and commitment to quality.
