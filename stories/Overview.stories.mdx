# Overview

From the [Storybook website](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction):

> Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

We use Storybook for our design system to make component-driven development, testing, and communication easier.

Storybook shows us all the supported use cases for our components without hooking them up to an app with data.
